# Todos App

This is a simple little express app that I have thrown together mainly for a 
training course I am currently teaching (Connecting to an API using an iOS app).

But anyone is free to use this if you want.

###Requirements
Simply clone down the repo using `git clone` into a directory of your choice.

You will need to have mongoDB installed globally on your machine, you can get this using hombrew on a mac. `brew install mongodb`

Start mongo using the `mongod` command.

Then `cd` into the project directory and run `npm install`

Once done you can then run the app using `node app.js` and it should be good to go.
